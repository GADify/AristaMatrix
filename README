Basically an edit of the excellent work done by Tom Wallroth. Original source
can be found here: http://github.com/devsnd/matrix-curses/

I just altered the characters being used and changed the color scheme. I also
tweaked some settings such as mostly disabling windows because I didn't like
the way those looked. The code is largely the same and changes have been
commented.
